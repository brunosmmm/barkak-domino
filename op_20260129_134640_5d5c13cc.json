Need to implement an automatic meandering/snaking path system where dominoes arrange themselves in a path that stays visible within the table bounds, turning/wrapping as needed.\n\nCurrent approach: Single horizontal scrollable row that extends infinitely right.\nProblem: Poor UX on mobile, requires manual scrolling, tiles go off-screen.\nSolution: Dynamic path that snakes/meanders within visible table area.",
