The remaining tiles form the \"boneyard\".\n\n**Current behavior:** Players may be receiving more tiles than allowed\n**Expected:** \n- Each player gets exactly 6 tiles\n- Remaining tiles displayed on the side, face-down (backs visible, no one can see values)\n- Boneyard is for dramatic effect only - tiles are inaccessible during standard play\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Backend: Limit distribution to 6 tiles per player\n- Frontend: Show boneyard pile on side with face-down tiles for atmosphere",
