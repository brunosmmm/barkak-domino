    "text": "Create a Puppeteer-based automated testing system for end-to-end gameplay testing that Claude can use autonomously to debug features.\n\n## Goals\n- Fully autonomous game testing without human intervention\n- Visual verification of game states (tiles, board, players)\n- Simulate multi-player games (multiple browser instances)\n- Integration with Claude Code for automatic debugging workflows\n\n## Components Needed\n1. **Puppeteer test harness** - Launch game, control multiple players\n2. **Game state extraction** - Read DOM to understand current game state\n3. **Action API** - Click tiles, pass turns, send reactions, etc.\n4. **Assertion helpers** - Verify expected game states\n5. **Screenshot/recording** - Capture failures for debugging\n6. **Claude integration** - Hooks/skills for Claude to run tests and interpret results\n\n## Use Cases\n- Regression testing after changes\n- Reproduce reported bugs automatically\n- Stress testing (rapid moves, disconnects)\n- Visual testing (UI renders correctly)\n- Claude-driven debugging: \"test the tile picking phase\" \u2192 runs tests \u2192 reports issues",
