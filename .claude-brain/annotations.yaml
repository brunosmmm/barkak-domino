  text: 'Overhaul UI theming with "drinking, smoking, based" aesthetic.


    **Design Direction:**

    - Bar/lounge atmosphere, neon accents, vintage/retro feel

    - Darker/grittier color palette, edgy typography

    - Smoke, whiskey, playing cards vibe


    **Image Assets Needed:**

    - Background: smoky bar scene or felt table with drinks/ashtrays

    - Domino tiles: weathered/vintage texture, maybe gold accents

    - Player avatars: stylized characters (optional)

    - Victory/defeat screens: celebratory vs dejected themed

    - UI elements: buttons, panels with neon/glow effects

    - Logo/branding: "Barkak Domino" stylized


    **AI Image Tools (need setup guidance):**

    - Midjourney: Best quality, Discord-based, ~$10/mo

    - Stable Diffusion: Free, runs locally, needs GPU or cloud

    - DALL-E API: Easy integration, pay-per-image


    Note: User needs walkthrough on using these tools.'

  text: 'Add "epic moment" detection and visual effects for statistically unlikely
    plays.


    **Triggers to detect:**

    - Playing last tile to win (domino!)

    - Playing a double-6 as first move

    - Winning with 0 passes made

    - Clearing multiple tiles in quick succession

    - Comeback win when opponent had 1-2 tiles left

    - Perfect game (win without ever being blocked)

    - Blocking all opponents simultaneously


    **Visual Effects (broadcast to all players):**

    - Screen shake

    - Particle explosions / confetti

    - Dramatic slow-mo animation of the tile being played

    - Sound effects (glass clink, crowd gasp, airhorn)

    - Special message overlay: "DOMINO!", "CLUTCH!", "LEGENDARY PLAY"

    - Glow/highlight on the player who made the play


    **Implementation:**

    - Backend: Calculate odds/detect special conditions after each move

    - WebSocket: Broadcast "epic_moment" event with type and player

    - Frontend: Trigger appropriate animation/sound based on type'
