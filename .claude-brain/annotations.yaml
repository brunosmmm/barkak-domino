    **Design Direction:**

    - Bar/lounge atmosphere, neon accents, vintage/retro feel

    - Darker/grittier color palette, edgy typography

    - Smoke, whiskey, playing cards vibe


    **Image Assets Needed:**

    - Background: smoky bar scene or felt table with drinks/ashtrays

    - Domino tiles: weathered/vintage texture, maybe gold accents

    - Player avatars: stylized characters (optional)

    - Victory/defeat screens: celebratory vs dejected themed

    - UI elements: buttons, panels with neon/glow effects

    - Logo/branding: "Barkak Domino" stylized


    **AI Image Tools (need setup guidance):**

    - Midjourney: Best quality, Discord-based, ~$10/mo

    - Stable Diffusion: Free, runs locally, needs GPU or cloud

    - DALL-E API: Easy integration, pay-per-image


    Note: User needs walkthrough on using these tools.'

  text: 'Add "epic moment" detection and visual effects for statistically unlikely
    plays.


    **Triggers to detect:**

    - Playing last tile to win (domino!)

    - Playing a double-6 as first move

    - Winning with 0 passes made

    - Clearing multiple tiles in quick succession

    - Comeback win when opponent had 1-2 tiles left

    - Perfect game (win without ever being blocked)

    - Blocking all opponents simultaneously


    **Visual Effects (broadcast to all players):**

    - Screen shake

    - Particle explosions / confetti

    - Dramatic slow-mo animation of the tile being played

    - Sound effects (glass clink, crowd gasp, airhorn)

    - Special message overlay: "DOMINO!", "CLUTCH!", "LEGENDARY PLAY"

    - Glow/highlight on the player who made the play


    **Implementation:**

    - Backend: Calculate odds/detect special conditions after each move

    - WebSocket: Broadcast "epic_moment" event with type and player

    - Frontend: Trigger appropriate animation/sound based on type'

  text: '## Visual Distinction for Multiple Play Options


    When a player has a domino that can be played on both ends of the board, make
    it visually clear that there are multiple options.


    ### Scenarios:

    1. **Same tile can go left OR right** - Board ends are different values, but the
    selected tile matches both

    2. **Tile orientation matters** - The tile could be flipped to match different
    patterns


    ### UI Ideas:

    - Highlight both ends of the board when a playable tile is selected

    - Show arrows or indicators pointing to valid play spots

    - Animate/pulse the valid board ends

    - Color-code: green glow on valid ends

    - Show a split button: "Play Left ← | → Play Right"

    - When hovering over an end, show preview of how the tile would be placed


    ### Current Behavior:

    - User must manually choose left/right after selecting a tile

    - Not obvious when both options are available


    ### Suggested Implementation:

    1. When tile is selected, calculate which ends it can play on

    2. If multiple ends valid, show both with visual indicators

    3. Clicking on a highlighted end plays there directly

    4. Alternative: show "Choose side" modal with previews'

  text: 'Interactive tile picking phase before game starts.


    **Feature:** Instead of automatically dealing tiles, show a grid of face-down
    tiles. Players asynchronously click to claim tiles (no turn order needed during
    picking).


    **Flow:**

    1. Game created → Show 28 face-down tiles in a grid

    2. All players can click tiles simultaneously to claim them

    3. Each player claims 6 tiles (their limit)

    4. Once all players have 6 tiles, game begins with normal turn order

    5. Remaining tiles become the boneyard (shown but inaccessible)


    **Implementation:**

    - Backend: Track which tiles are claimed by whom during picking phase

    - Frontend: Grid of clickable face-down tiles, show claimed count per player

    - WebSocket: Broadcast tile claims in real-time'
