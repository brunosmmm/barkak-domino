  text: "## Multi-Round Team Scoring System\n\n### Core Concept\nTransform single-game\
    \ play into multi-round sessions with persistent scoring.\n\n### Team Play (4\
    \ players)\n- Opposite players are teammates (like sitting at a round table)\n\
    - Player 0 + Player 2 vs Player 1 + Player 3\n- Team score accumulates across\
    \ rounds\n- First team to reach target score wins (e.g., 100 points)\n\n### Individual\
    \ Scoring Fallback (2-3 players)\n- When fewer than 4 players, use individual\
    \ scoring\n- Each player accumulates points independently\n- First to target score\
    \ wins\n\n### Scoring Rules\n- Winner scores the total pip count of all opponents'\
    \ remaining tiles\n- On blocked game: lowest remaining pip count wins, scores\
    \ difference\n- Teams: combine teammate tiles for team pip count\n\n### UI Changes\
    \ Required\n\n1. **Table Visualization (small corner indicator)**\n   - Show 4\
    \ seats around a small table graphic\n   - Highlight occupied seats with player\
    \ avatars/names\n   - Color-code teams (e.g., red team vs blue team)\n   - Position:\
    \ lower-left or lower-right corner\n   - Subtle but informative\n\n2. **Score\
    \ Display**\n   - Persistent team/player scores across rounds\n   - Round counter\
    \ (Round 3 of ?)\n   - Target score progress bar\n   - \"Match point\" indicator\
    \ when near winning\n\n3. **Round Transition**\n   - \"Round Over\" overlay with\
    \ scoring breakdown\n   - Show tiles remaining in each hand\n   - Points awarded\
    \ animation\n   - \"Next Round\" button (or auto-start timer)\n   - Running team/player\
    \ scores update\n\n4. **Match End**\n   - \"Match Winner\" celebration screen\n\
    \   - Full score history/breakdown\n   - Option to rematch or return to lobby\n\
    \n### Backend Changes\n- Add `Match` model wrapping multiple `Game` rounds\n-\
    \ Track cumulative scores per player/team\n- Add `match_score`, `round_number`,\
    \ `target_score` fields\n- Preserve team assignments across rounds\n- Handle player\
    \ disconnection mid-match\n\n### State Model Addition\n```\nMatch {\n  id: string\n\
    \  games: Game[]  // completed rounds\n  current_game: Game\n  team_a: [player_id,\
    \ player_id]  // for 4p\n  team_b: [player_id, player_id]\n  scores: { team_a:\
    \ number, team_b: number } | { player_id: number }\n  target_score: number\n \
    \ is_team_game: boolean\n}\n```"

  text: '## Visual Distinction for Multiple Play Options


    When a player has a domino that can be played on both ends of the board, make
    it visually clear that there are multiple options.


    ### Scenarios:

    1. **Same tile can go left OR right** - Board ends are different values, but the
    selected tile matches both

    2. **Tile orientation matters** - The tile could be flipped to match different
    patterns


    ### UI Ideas:

    - Highlight both ends of the board when a playable tile is selected

    - Show arrows or indicators pointing to valid play spots

    - Animate/pulse the valid board ends

    - Color-code: green glow on valid ends

    - Show a split button: "Play Left ← | → Play Right"

    - When hovering over an end, show preview of how the tile would be placed


    ### Current Behavior:

    - User must manually choose left/right after selecting a tile

    - Not obvious when both options are available


    ### Suggested Implementation:

    1. When tile is selected, calculate which ends it can play on

    2. If multiple ends valid, show both with visual indicators

    3. Clicking on a highlighted end plays there directly

    4. Alternative: show "Choose side" modal with previews'

  text: 'Interactive tile picking phase before game starts.


    **Feature:** Instead of automatically dealing tiles, show a grid of face-down
    tiles. Players asynchronously click to claim tiles (no turn order needed during
    picking).


    **Flow:**

    1. Game created → Show 28 face-down tiles in a grid

    2. All players can click tiles simultaneously to claim them

    3. Each player claims 6 tiles (their limit)

    4. Once all players have 6 tiles, game begins with normal turn order

    5. Remaining tiles become the boneyard (shown but inaccessible)


    **Implementation:**

    - Backend: Track which tiles are claimed by whom during picking phase

    - Frontend: Grid of clickable face-down tiles, show claimed count per player

    - WebSocket: Broadcast tile claims in real-time'
