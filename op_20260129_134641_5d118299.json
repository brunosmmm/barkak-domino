    "text": "Interactive tile picking phase before game starts.\n\n**Feature:** Instead of automatically dealing tiles, show a grid of face-down tiles. Players asynchronously click to claim tiles (no turn order needed during picking).\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Game created \u2192 Show 28 face-down tiles in a grid\n2. All players can click tiles simultaneously to claim them\n3. Each player claims 6 tiles (their limit)\n4. Once all players have 6 tiles, game begins with normal turn order\n5. Remaining tiles become the boneyard (shown but inaccessible)\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Backend: Track which tiles are claimed by whom during picking phase\n- Frontend: Grid of clickable face-down tiles, show claimed count per player\n- WebSocket: Broadcast tile claims in real-time",
