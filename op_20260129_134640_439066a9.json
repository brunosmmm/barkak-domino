    "text": "FUNDAMENTAL BUG: Chain layout recalculates and re-centers ALL tile positions on every board update. This causes the entire game to shift/move as tiles are added.\n\nCORRECT BEHAVIOR:\n- First tile placed at table center - position is FIXED\n- Each new tile placed relative to chain end - then FIXED\n- Once a tile is placed, it CANNOT move\n- Only calculate position for newly added tile\n\nCurrent algorithm rebuilds from pivot and applies centering offset - this is wrong. Need to store positions incrementally and never recalculate existing tiles.",
