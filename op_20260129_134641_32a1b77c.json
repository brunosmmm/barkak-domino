    "text": "## Visual Distinction for Multiple Play Options\n\nWhen a player has a domino that can be played on both ends of the board, make it visually clear that there are multiple options.\n\n### Scenarios:\n1. **Same tile can go left OR right** - Board ends are different values, but the selected tile matches both\n2. **Tile orientation matters** - The tile could be flipped to match different patterns\n\n### UI Ideas:\n- Highlight both ends of the board when a playable tile is selected\n- Show arrows or indicators pointing to valid play spots\n- Animate/pulse the valid board ends\n- Color-code: green glow on valid ends\n- Show a split button: \"Play Left \u2190 | \u2192 Play Right\"\n- When hovering over an end, show preview of how the tile would be placed\n\n### Current Behavior:\n- User must manually choose left/right after selecting a tile\n- Not obvious when both options are available\n\n### Suggested Implementation:\n1. When tile is selected, calculate which ends it can play on\n2. If multiple ends valid, show both with visual indicators\n3. Clicking on a highlighted end plays there directly\n4. Alternative: show \"Choose side\" modal with previews",
